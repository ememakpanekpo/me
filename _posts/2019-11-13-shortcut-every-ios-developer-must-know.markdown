# 7 awesome shortcuts every iOS Developer must know

As a developer, knowing your IDE is one very powerful key to being productive while you work. Building for iOS with XCode can be daunting at first but here are a few shortcuts to keep you productive and make you feel like a pro.

**1. Open quickly any file (Shift + ⌘ + O)**

<div>
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/open-quickly.gif" alt="Alt Text">
        <figcaption class="caption">Photo Open quickly XCode</figcaption>
    </div>
		
With this you can search and open virtually anything in your XCode project. **Press**  `Shift + ⌘ + O` and the ***Open quickly*** dialog will pop up. 
Something like this: As you can see I searched for the AppDelegate file and main storyboard file for the project.

**2. Hide/UnHide the Navigator  Panel (⌘ + 0)**

<div>
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/hide-unhide-navigator-panel.gif" alt="Alt Text">
        <figcaption class="caption">Photo: Hide/unhide navigator panel</figcaption>
    </div>

The Navigator Panel is located on the left side of XCode and helps you navigate around the project. But more often than not you need some more real estate for your content at the center so you can work effectively. **Press**  `⌘ + 0` to hide/unhide the navigator panel.

**3. Hide/Unhide the Utility area (⌥ + ⌘ + 0)**

<div>
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/hide-unhide-utilities.gif" alt="Alt Text">
        <figcaption class="caption">Photo: Hide/unhide utility area</figcaption>
    </div>

You can hide/unhide the Utility area to gain more space for your content at the center.
The Utility area is located on the right side of XCode and contains different inspectors depending on which item is currently selected on the navigator panel.
**Press** `⌥ + ⌘ + 0` to hide/unhide the utility area.

**4. Quick Documentation (^ + ⌘ + ⇧ + ?) **

<div>
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/quick-documentation.gif" alt="Alt Text">
        <figcaption class="caption">Photo: Quick Documentation</figcaption>
    </div>

To quickly access documentation for any swift class. **Highlight** the required class and **Press** `^ + ⌘ + ⇧ + ?`. You will be presented with a pop up dialog showing you the class documentation. This however requires internet connection.

Alternatively you can get there faster by *pressing and holding the ⌥ key and then left clicking* on any swift class. 
Once you press the ⌥ key, your cursor will change to a **+** icon, which you can move around. When it comes across any swift class it changes to a **?** icon, you then you can now left click on this class to view the documentation.

<div>
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/show-documentation-2.gif" alt="Alt Text">
        <figcaption class="caption">Photo: Quick Documentation</figcaption>
    </div>

**5. Reformat/Indent your code(^ + I)**

<div>
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/indent-code.gif" alt="Alt Text">
        <figcaption class="caption">Photo: Indent Code</figcaption>
    </div>

Unorganised code can be difficult to read and review. Save you future self and code reviewer needless stress by organising your code before you commit. There is no need to manually indent as XCode will indent it for you as per the style guide.
Select the code area you want to format correctly and then **Press** `^ + I`

**6. Hide/Unhide the debug and console panel (⇧ + ⌘ + Y)**

<div>
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/hide-unhide-debug-panel.gif" alt="Alt Text">
        <figcaption class="caption">Photo: Hide/unhide debug and console panel</figcaption>
    </div>
		
You can hide/unhide the debug and conosole panel to gain more space for your content at the center. The console panel is to the bottom right and the debug panel is to the bottom left. 
**Press** `⇧ + ⌘ + Y` to hide/unhide the debug and console panel.

**7. Make a quick commit (⌥ + ⌘ + C)**

<div>
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/make-a-commit.gif" alt="Alt Text">
        <figcaption class="caption">Photo: Making a commit</figcaption>
    </div>

Are you done working on a cool feature and you want to make a commit. The first shocker most iOS developers have in XCode is the absence of a terminal. No big worries about that if you just want to make a commit.  Just **Press** `⌥ + ⌘ + C`
